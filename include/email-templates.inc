The most likely reason is that you did not read the reasons for
which VCS accounts are granted, and your request failed to meet
the list of acceptable criteria.

We urge you to make another appeal for a VCS account, but first
it helps to write the appropriate list and:

 * Introduce yourself
 * Explain what you want to work on
 * And show what work you've already done (patches)

Choose a list that relates to your request:

 * Internals:     internals@lists.php.net 
 * Documentation: phpdoc@lists.php.net 
 * PECL:          pecl-dev@lists.php.net 
 * PEAR:          pear-group@lists.php.net 
 * Other:         group@php.net 

PHP accounts are granted to developers who have earned the trust
of existing PHP developers through patches, and have demonstrated
the ability to work with others.
